title: Monitoring and Evaluation
---

We help our clients monitor their ongoing activities and provide all the stakeholders with early detailed information on the progress or delay of the ongoing assessed activities. Through our evaluation process, we provide recommendations and lessons to our clients as well as help them report to their donors about the implemented activities.These are dynamic iterative learning processes validating the supporting role of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions. It is the culmination of the monitoring and evaluation process.
